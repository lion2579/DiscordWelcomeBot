# DiscordWelcomeBot
This is a welcome bot for discord servers. 

To use, download the file, and fill out the empty variables. 
 > welcomeMessage contains your welcome message. Make this a string.
 > welcomeChannelID is intended to contain the ID of the channel where your welcome message should be posted. Right-click        on the channel in discord's UI and choose the "Copy ID" option. You'll then be able to paste it into the variable. Int is ideal.
 > botToken is your bot's token. Follow (this link)[https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html#discord-intro] for more information on how to get that. 
 >You have the option of adding a help message. On line 34, edit the string in any way you prefer.
